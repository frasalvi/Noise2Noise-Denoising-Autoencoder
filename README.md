# Noise2Noise Denoising Autoencoder

In this project, we implement a denoising autoencoder trained only with noisy images, inspired by the paper [Noise2Noise: Learning Image Restoration without Clean Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04189). 

- In [Miniproject 1](Miniproject_1/), we implement such decoder using PyTorch, reaching performances similar to the original architecture but with 20x less parameters. Our experiments and findings are summarized in [Report 1](Miniproject_1/Report_1.pdf).
- In [Miniproject 2](Miniproject_2/), we implement such decoder from scratch, writing all the building blocks on our own. Our implementation choices and experiments are summarized in [Report 2](Miniproject_2/Report_2.pdf).
